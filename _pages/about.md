Research Interests
------
Less than 15% of the global ocean has been mapped with direct measurement. My research interests are focused seafloor bathymetry
and understanding the processes that form and modify it.  This involves ocean mapping with a variety of sonar techniques to acoustically 
quantify the depth and characteristics of the seafloor complemented with visual observations from photos and videos.  Visual observations
derived from photos and videos provide ground-truth of our acoustic observations.

I've been at [LDEO](https://ldeo.columbia.edu) since 2006, and was previously at the 
[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution] (http://www.whoi.edu) where I served as the inaugural Data Manager for
the National Deep Submergence Facility.

As a geoinformaticist, I work to ensure that marine geoscience data are documented, preserved and accessible.  I am especially
interested in bridging the gap between data and people and helping to add value to earth science data
