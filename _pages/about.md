Research Interests
------
Seafloor bathymetry data is fundamental to a broad variety of oceanographic studies, yet less than 15% of the global ocean has been mapped 
with direct measurement. Most of what we know about the shape of the seafloor is based on low resolution satellite observations of 
the sea surface which is used to predict water depth.

My research is focused on gathering and integrating seafloor bathymetry data to better understanding the processes that form and modify the seafloor 
and to empower the world to better understand the more than 2/3 of our world that is hidden from sight by the ocean. 
I've been working with seafloor mapping data for more than 20 years, and have had the opportunity to work with a variety of systems and platforms.
In addition to using sonar techniques to acoustically quantify the depth and characteristics of the seafloor, visual observations from photos and videos 
provide ground-trush data for our acoustic observations and allow us to directly see otherwise inaccessible regions of the planet.

With more than a decade of experience as a geoinformaticist, I work to ensure that marine geoscience data are documented, preserved and accessible.  I am especially
interested in helping to add value to earth science data by bridging the gap between data and people.  This involves developing 
innovative new ways for people to interact with and access data.

I've been at [LDEO](https://ldeo.columbia.edu) since 2006, and was previously at the 
[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](http://www.whoi.edu) where I served as the inaugural Data Manager for
the National Deep Submergence Facility.
