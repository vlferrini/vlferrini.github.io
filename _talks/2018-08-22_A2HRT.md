###MEETING OVERVIEW: 

Technologies such as lidar, multibeam sonar, structure from motion photogrammetry, and synthetic aperture radar have transformed the acquisition of high resolution terrain, bathymetry, and vegetation structure data. Petabytes of data have been collected, but their full scientific utilization is still limited. This A2 HRT Workshop is organized through an NSF-funded EarthCube Research Coordination Network (RCN) to bring together the Earth science community to discuss technical challenges and cyberinfrastructure requirements to answer scientific questions, coordinate research activities, and share best practices and resources. The first part of the workshop will be comprised of talks, pop-ups, and discussion sessions. Tutorials on advanced methods for HRT analysis will be offered in the second part of the workshop. Participants are expected to attend the workshop for the full duration. Funding is available for partial support of participants. Space is limited.
