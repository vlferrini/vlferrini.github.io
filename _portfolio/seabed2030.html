<div>[Seabed 2030](http://seabed2030.org) is a collaborative project between the Nippon Foundation and [GEBCO](http://www.gebco.net). It aims to bring together all available bathymetric data to produce the definitive map of the world ocean floor by 2030 and make it available to all. It builds on more than 100 years of GEBCO's history in global seafloor mapping.</div>
